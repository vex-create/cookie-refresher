# Refresh Roblox Cookies

**this method was held secret for such a long time** i dont get why... so **i** decided to reveal it 

since its all written in php you need a localhost (i use xampp) 
if you can read the code it cleary says you need to go to 

localhost/yourfile.php?cookie=cookie_you_wanna_refresh

and thats it 
if you need help or want more tools to buy dm me on discord
